# CRUDPhotoAlbum

This is a test app, to demonstrate building a photo album with horizontal scrolling of pictures.

The first tab displays scrollable pictures using a ScrollView, the second tab was supposed to display scrollable pictures using a PageViewController. However, the PageViewController method proved to be overkill for what I was trying to do. So, I abandoned this idea.

The third tab displays scrollable pictures using a 1 X N CollectionView, which worked out a lot better for me, so I went with this method.

Thanks to Wikimedia Commons for the pictures.
